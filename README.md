ðŸ”¢ RPN Math Interpreter Calculator

Welcome to the RPN Math Interpreter Calculator! This Python project is an interactive Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions in a unique and efficient way. With this calculator, you can perform complex calculations and explore the power of RPN notation.

ðŸŒŸ Features:

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN): Leverage the benefits of RPN notation to input mathematical expressions. Experience the simplicity of placing operators after the operands, making complex calculations more intuitive.
Interactive Interface: Enjoy a user-friendly interface that allows you to input expressions and obtain immediate results. Forget about parentheses and let the RPN algorithm handle the calculations effortlessly.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease. The calculator supports both integers and floating-point numbers, ensuring precise results.
Stack Visualization: Visualize the stack operations in real-time, gaining a better understanding of how the RPN algorithm processes the input.
Error Handling: The calculator includes robust error handling to provide meaningful feedback in case of invalid expressions or mathematical errors.

ðŸš€ Getting Started:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
Run the main.py script to start the RPN Math Interpreter Calculator.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input expressions and see the results.

ðŸ”§ Usage:

Input a mathematical expression in RPN notation and press Enter to evaluate it.
Use spaces to separate the operators and operands. For example: 5 2 +.
The calculator will display the intermediate steps and the final result.

ðŸ“š Examples:

Addition:
<code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-makefile"><span class="hljs-section">Input: 3 4 +</span>
<span class="hljs-section">Output: 7</span>
</code>

Division:
<code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-makefile"><span class="hljs-section">Input: 10 2 /</span>
<span class="hljs-section">Output: 5.0</span>
</code>

Complex Expression:
<code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-makefile"><span class="hljs-section">Input: ((3 2 +) (4 1 /) *)</span>
<span class="hljs-section">Output: 4</span>
</code>
